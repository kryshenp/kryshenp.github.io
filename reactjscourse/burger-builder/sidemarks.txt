brand new project created with create-react-app

to enable css modules
to be sure that css classes I create in a css file can be scoped to a specific
component in the app so that they are not applied globally when I accidentally
reuse the same css class

for that I need eject the project by 'yarn eject', so I have an access to the config
in the config folder and there to 2 webpack configuration files.

In part where I have CSS test and the css-loader, there i have to add `modules: true,`
to the options of that loader and add `localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]'
option to basically define the css class name it will automatically generate and
assign. This should take the original name then the local name of the component and
then a randomly generated hash. This will generate this unique css classnames, which
are then assign automatically once we import them through that object from the css
file

Then I copy these 2 lines with `modules` and `localIdentName` and copy them to the
config file of the production build.

With that I have my project setup and can get started.
