brand new project created with create-react-app

to enable css modules
to be sure that css classes I create in a css file can be scoped to a specific
component in the app so that they are not applied globally when I accidentally
reuse the same css class

for that I need eject the project by 'yarn eject', so I have an access to the config
in the config folder and there to 2 webpack configuration files.

In part where I have CSS test and the css-loader, there i have to add `modules: true,`
to the options of that loader and add `localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]'
option to basically define the css class name it will automatically generate and
assign. This should take the original name then the local name of the component and
then a randomly generated hash. This will generate this unique css classnames, which
are then assign automatically once we import them through that object from the css
file

Then I copy these 2 lines with `modules` and `localIdentName` and copy them to the
config file of the production build.

With that I have my project setup and can get started.

----------------------------

Do some cleanup work:
remove logo svg file which was created automatically and I don't need
and remove its import in the App.js file, and cleanup the appjs content here.
remove the className APP from the parent div and remove the App.css import
and remove the app.css file

in index.css I want to use Open Sans font family, choose it form google fonts, customize
it and with the embed link add it to the public/index.html file and add it right above
the title
